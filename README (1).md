## FAQ

#### 1. What is Python? What are the benefits of using Python?
--A Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language. Being a
general-purpose language, it can be used to build almost any type of application with
the right tools/libraries. Additionally, python supports objects, modules, threads,
exception-handling, and automatic memory management which help in modelling
real-world problems and building applications to solve these problems.
 
--Benefits of using Python:
Python is a general-purpose programming language that has a simple, easy-tolearn syntax that emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of
program maintenance. Moreover, the language is capable of scripting, is
completely open-source, and supports third-party packages encouraging
modularity and code reuse.
Its high-level data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic
binding, attract a huge community of developers for Rapid Application
Development and deployment.
#### What is the use of help() and dir() functions?

--help() function in Python is used to display the documentation of modules, classes,
functions, keywords, etc. If no parameter is passed to the help() function, then an
interactive help utility is launched on the console.
--dir() function tries to return a valid list of attributes and methods of the object it is
called upon. It behaves differently with different objects, as it aims to produce the
most relevant data, rather than the complete information.
For Modules/Library objects, it returns a list of all attributes, contained in that
module.
For Class Objects, it returns a list of all valid attributes and base attributes.
With no arguments passed, it returns a list of attributes in the current scope.
